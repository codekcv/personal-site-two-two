                III. I learned it by reading guides &amp; documentations online,
                and since then have enjoyed the art of programming to heart. I
                made tower defense games, battle arenas, hero campaign maps,

                Unity3D to make 1st person games, although nothing serious, just
                for fun and messing around with my friends. I did learn maths in
